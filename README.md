This package is designed to clean features out of on-the-fly mapping data cubes created by the [James Clerk Maxwell Telescope](http://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/).  The package uses an FFT-based approach.  Spatial frequencies associated with the striping have their aplitudes reduced to be similar to neighbouring values and their phases are replaced with uniform noise.  The code contains several parameters that are hardwired to suite the specific project the approach was designed for.

The code was developed by
